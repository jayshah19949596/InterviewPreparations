# https://leetcode.com/problems/design-in-memory-file-system/
# Design an in-memory file system to simulate the following functions:
# ls: Given a path in string format. If it is a file path, return
# a list that only contains this file's name. If it is
# a directory path, return the list of file and directory
# names in this directory. Your output (file and directory
# names together) should in lexicographic order.
# mkdir: Given a directory path that does not exist, you should
# make a new directory according to the path. If the
# middle directories in the path don't exist either, you should
# create them as well. This function has void return type.
# addContentToFile: Given a file path and file content in string
# format. If the file doesn't exist, you need to create
# that file containing given content. If the file already exists,
# you need to append given content to original content.
# This function has void return type.
# readContentFromFile: Given a file path, return its content in string format.

# Define a Folder as a mapping from names of files/folders
# to other Folders or None (for files). File system consists
# of root folder and mapping from file names to their contents.
# Separate file mapping speeds content retrieval/update.
# Time - O(1) for constructor. O(s + n + m log m) for ls
# where s = path number of chars, n = number of folders in
# path, m = number of results in final folder. O(s + n)
# for mkdir. O(s + n + t) for addContentToFile where t is
# total content. O(t) for readContentFromFile.
# Space - O(total nb folders + total content length)
