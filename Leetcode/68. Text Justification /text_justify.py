# https://leetcode.com/problems/text-justification/
# Given an array of words and a length L, format the text such that each
# line has exactly L characters and is fully (left and right) justified.
# Pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces
# ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly L characters.
# Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible.
# If the number of spaces on a line do not divide evenly between words, the empty
# slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.
# For the last line of text, it should be left justified
# and no extra space is inserted between words.
# Each word is guaranteed not to exceed L in length.

# Fill lines with words and single spaces until full.
#  Then justify by distributing remaining spaces
# Time - O(maxWidth * nb_lines)
# Space - O(maxWidth * nb_lines)
