# https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-in-a-grid-with-obstacles-elimination/
# Given a m * n grid, where each cell is either 0 (empty) or 1 (obstacle).
# In one step, you can move up, down, left or right from and to an empty cell.
# Return the minimum number of steps to walk
# from the upper left corner (0, 0) to
# the lower right corner (m-1, n-1) given that
# you can eliminate at most k obstacles.
# If it is not possible to find such walk return -1.

# A-star search with heuristic of Manhattan distance.
# Repeatedly visit the state with the lowest heuristic +
# steps taken, ties broken by most remaining eliminations.
# Do not revisit the same cell with the same or fewer eliminations.
# Time - O(mnk log mnk) for grid of size mn each cell may be visited k times.
# Space - O(mnk)
