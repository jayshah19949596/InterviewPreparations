# Dijkstra algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph
# It does not work for graphs with negative weight cycle.
# It may give correct results for a graph with negative edges but you must allow a vertex can be visited multiple times
# and that version will lose its fast time complexity.
# For graphs with negative weight edges and cycles, Bellmanâ€“Ford algorithm can be used
# It can handle graphs consisting of cycles.
# Application:
#      1. Used in routing protocols.
# Limitation:
#      1. It does not work for graphs with negative weights.
# Complexity Analysis:
#       V is number of vertices
#       E is number of edges
#       Time Complexity: O((E+V)*log|V|)
#       Space Complexity: O(V)
